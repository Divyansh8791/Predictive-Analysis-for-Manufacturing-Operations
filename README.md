# Predictive-Analysis-for-Manufacturing-Operations
This repository implements a predictive analysis API for manufacturing operations using Python and FastAPI. It predicts machine downtime or production defects via endpoints for data upload, model training, and real-time predictions. Built with scikit-learn, it includes a sample dataset, supports local testing, and provides detailed documentation.
